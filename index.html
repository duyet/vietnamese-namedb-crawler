<p>Vietnamese Names Database. Contains surnames or family names. Auto extract from Crawler and Machine Learning.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Vietnamese personal names generally consist of three parts: a family name, a middle name, and a given name, used in that order. The "family name first" order follows the system of Chinese names and is common throughout the Chinese cultural sphere, but is different from Chinese, Korean, and Japanese names in having a middle name. Persons can be referred to by either the whole name, the given name, or a hierarchic pronoun in normal usage. </p>
